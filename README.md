# js-testing-introduction. 

Repository used to demonstrate the process of writing tests in JS  
  
The application doesn't need any server, just open intex.html. It's good to run `npm start` if you make any changes in the production code.

# To run the tests written in jest
use `npm test`  
  
you can also add --watch to script>test in package.json like this:  
`"test": "jest --watch"` Tests will then run after any change  
  
More info about jest: https://jestjs.io
